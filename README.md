## Objective :
The mission is simple: Sharing knowledge with the world, providing trusthworthy solutions and to enjoy

## Motivation :
Get in touch with as many geotechnical engineers, domain expertise, stakeholders as possible and creating a shared network by increasing the usage of calculations presented here.

## Promise :
Saving time and decreasing errors... Last but not least, providing solutions for communities' needs.

## Who am i ! 
I'm a geotechnical engineer passionate about Data Science and Web development. When I first started working on my master degree thesis, preparing my site investigation charts was too time consuming due to the absence of automated calculation & grapher tools. wich lmakes me wonder if it was possible to automate all those annoying and time consuming tasks with python, So I prepared some Python scripts to overcome the time issue but it has its own limits. So, I started developing simple grapher scripts and calculators to lessen the time I spend preparing geotechnical reports. Later, my friends started using them too. And they liked the idea of online Grapher/calculator because of its simplicity and accessibility. After that, I thought not only my Friends and I, but also any geotechnical engineer or engineering student could benefit from these tools developed. So, here we are...
